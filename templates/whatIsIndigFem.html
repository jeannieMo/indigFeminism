        <p>Out of all the feminisms I’ve done research on, indigenous feminism has been the most thought-provoking and trail blazing mode of feminism in my eyes. From what I understand, Indigenous feminism’s goal requires a dismantling of society as we know it today because of its call towards depatriarchalization and decolonization, two structures within our modern day framework that I am unable to imagine a society without. The main ideas I gathered from reading about indigenous feminism is the importance of intersectionality within feminism, and recognizing that indigenous women face a “double oppression” due to colonial legacy.</p>

        <b>What is indigenous feminism?</b><br><br>
        <p>With help from the article Feminismos indígenas from the website modii, I’d define indigenous feminism as a feminist movement that, unlike western feminism which is much more individualistic, prioritizes collective thinking and seeks to promote gender equality within an indigenous context.</p>
        
        <b>The importance of intersectionality within feminism in order to include indigenous women</b><br><br>
        <p>Indigenous feminism exists as a byproduct of the established, monolithic feminist movements that were not welcoming to indigenous women. I turned to the interview we read for class, “Aura Cumes: “Ser sujetas dialógicas demanda una escucha””, from the site, Rialta, for information regarding how current feminist movements need to do better with promoting an intersectional approach to gender rights. Dr. Aura Cumes belongs to the Kaqchikel Mayan people in Guatemala and is a writer, teacher, activist, and main female voice of the indigenous movement in Latin America. In this piece, Cumes emphasizes the importance of realizing that women have diverse backgrounds and experiences, therefore feminist movements have to broaden their view on what fighting against the sources of female oppression looks like. Cumes detailed her experience feeling between two worlds: not fully fitting into the mayan activist movement because men would deny the existence of machismo within the culture, and not fitting into current feminist movements because they treated her as an inferior who needed guidance - aligning with racist thought and colonial systems. Cumes states that when current feminism "looks towards indigenous and black women, it sees them as part of backward cultures that will only overcome if they adopt Western culture and its emancipatory principles as the only possible ones," highlighting how current feminist movements, which are largely middle class and white, are reproducing the colonial and racist thought that indigenous and minority women must adapt to the construction of today's society as well as adopt their monolithic view of what the goals of feminism look like. As I’ve learned throughout my educational career and research on feminism, socioeconomically impoverished, minority, and indigenous women experience more oppression than middle class white women, so it's unfair to have to make those backgrounds conform to this one feminist view. In Cumes and other indigenous womens’ cases, they wish to challenge and transform the structures, systems, and mindsets that perpetuate colonialism and its legacies within their fight of feminism because colonialism is what has placed indigenous bodies at the bottom of the racial system. As Maria Galindo, a prominent latin america feminist says in her book, No Se Puede Descolonizar Despatriarcalizar, "There are many stagnant movements that stretch and eternalize their proclamation and self-affirmation and refuse to accept that this is a moment, a step, a stage in a liberation process and not liberation itself" (56), which I believe perfectly paints the fact that current feminist groups that make a stride that benefits one set of women do not usually continue with that momentum to help other, more impoverished women like the indigenous. Western feminism does not seem to have a perspective informed by decolonization, so indigenous women have had to forge a form of feminism that is informed by their experiences of exclusion, creating a more accommodating feminist movement.</p>
        
        <b>Indigenous women face a “double oppression” due to colonial legacy that cannot be ignored</b><br><br>
        <p>It is crucial to recognize that decolonization is a major part of indigenous feminism. In her paper, La "India" Como "Sirvienta": Servidumbre doméstica, colonialismo, y patriarcado en Guatemala, Aura Cumes states that "The 'indian' as 'servant' combines two words used to oppress. If each of these expressions separately is used as insults or offenses, together they have a much greater degrading weight. Being 'indian' is not claimed in Guatemala as it is in the countries of South America." (10) Calling indigenous women “india'' is so normalized that Latin Americans don't even recognize how just that racial categorization or label is already offensive enough in itself, and adding the stereotype that all indigenous women are sirvientas is solidifying the fact that they are less than. A powerful quote from Cumes’ piece is that "The attitude of slave owners towards female slaves was governed by a criterion of convenience: when it was of interest to exploit them as if they were men, they were considered, for all intents and purposes, as if they had no gender; but when "They could be exploited, punished, and repressed in ways only suitable for women, they were reduced to their exclusively female role." (31) I view this anecdote as detailing the hierarchy among race and sexism - at first, indigenous slaves were seen as a whole inferior race, but once slave owners wanted to exert their oppression in a manner one can infer alludes to sexual abuse, the hierarchy within that race of indigeneity was made, with women being further oppressed and classified as “other” from indigenous males. In the present day, indigenous women are ridiculed for representing their culture through wearing their traditional clothing and rudely called “Maria 's”, a term that refers to servitude, when walking down the street. As Cumes states, "the colonizers never left, they stayed and built their own State to take care of the colonial wealth acquired during 300 years of domination...it was thought that if the indigenous people were poor it was because they were degenerate races, and if the whites were well off it was because their race must be superior." Our current society and stereotypes around the racial disparities are built off of the oppression of indigenous and minority groups from when Latin America was first colonized. Adding on, Cumes says that "Whites can move around the world without any problem. If you are white you are welcome in Latin America, Asia, Africa, Europe, and the United States, but if you are not, then the borders are closed." In order for indigenous women to enjoy freedom from oppression, they must also be free from the oppression that colonialism has imposed on them - because, as Cumes says, "the borders are closed." Decolonization is imperative to the true liberation of indigenous women.</p>

<b>Community Discussion</b><br><br>

<p>Upon doing a deeper dive into indigenous feminism, I came across the article, “territorio cuerpo tierra”, from the website modii, which expressed that "the violation of the rights of indigenous and tribal girls and women in places where mega-projects are implemented can take the form of trafficking, prostitution, and slavery. In this sense, the land and territories cannot be defended without first defending their bodies." which led me to believe that Indigenous women cannot fight for land rights without women's rights. In that sense, I wonder if indigenous feminism is separated into two phases, one that first fights for intersectional women’s rights and then decolonization? From what I’ve read, it seems that both decolonization and intersectional feminism are fought for hand in hand, but in actual practice, I’m concerned if it would be too big of a problem to fight for both at the same time - not to say that fighting for women's rights without decolonization would no longer be indigenous feminism as I'm sure their perspective of their feminist fight would be informed by their background and experiences as indigenous women. This ties into the bigger question I had, which is, which structure do indigenous women aim to dismantle first? Colonialism or patriarchy? As the quote I included above said, you cannot fight for land rights without women's rights, but you cannot fight for women's rights without dismantling the patriarchal framework that was amplified by colonizing westerners.</p>
