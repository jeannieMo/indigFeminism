        <b>The Liberation and Safety of Indigenous Women </b><br>

Founded in 2024, this organization has a mission to uphold indigenous sovereignty, preserve cultural traditions, and combat the widespread issue of femicide. <br><br>

We define sovereignty as empowering indigenous communities to maintain control and protection over their ancestral lands. Defending territorial rights is paramount to our cause.<br><br>

As noted by decolonial feminist and scholar Nuria Ciofalo, 'Focusing on these vivencias (experiences) and convivial dialogues...women can build transformative partnerships for community healing, survival, and resistance' (65). We hold this notion as integral to sustaining indigenous cultures. Women must lead at the forefront of this movement.<br><br>

Our organization stands firmly against the rampant violence and killings decimating indigenous women across nations. Through advocacy, grassroots initiatives, and legal reforms, we strive to dismantle systemic injustices and ensure the liberation and safety of indigenous women in their homelands.<br><br><br>
